// Day 15 - Summary / Consolidation

// Congratulations! You made it through all the fundamentals of the Swift programming language. Each day was purposefully very short to give you a solid introduction to the topic, but today is different because we‚Äôre going to be reviewing almost everything you learned so far.

// Repetition helps us learn things more thoroughly. These fundamentals are really important in all the Swift you‚Äôll write, so it‚Äôs worth doubling down to make sure you understand them fully.

// Some concepts only make complete sense when you‚Äôve understood other concepts. Circling back like this will help link together the core Swift concepts in your head.

// You might have missed something. Let‚Äôs face it, you‚Äôve just gone through a ton of videos about the most important parts of Swift ‚Äì are you absolutely sure you remembered all of it?

// You‚Äôll see how far you‚Äôve come. When you read about arrays and loops ‚Äì things you might have found challenging previously ‚Äì hopefully you‚Äôll find them easier now, and feel good that you‚Äôre making progress.

singer2.name = "Justin"
print(singer1.name)

// The third difference is that all copies of a class instance share their data, meaning that changes you make to one will automatically change other copies.



// MARK: Protocols

// Protocols define functionality we expect a data type to support, and Swift ensures our code follows those rules.

protocol VehicleCar {
	func estimateTime(for distance: Int) -> Int
	func travel(distance: Int)
}

// That lists the required methods for this protocol to work, but doesn‚Äôt contain any code ‚Äì we‚Äôre specifying only method names, parameters, and return types.

// Once you have a protocol you can make data types conform to it by implementing the required functionality. For example, we could make a Car struct that conforms to Vehicle:

struct NewCar: VehicleCar {
	func estimateTime(for distance: Int) -> Int {
		distance / 50
	}

	func travel(distance: Int) {
		print("I'm driving \(distance)km.")
	}
}

func commute(distance: Int, using vehicle: VehicleCar) {
	if vehicle.estimateTime(for: distance) > 100 {
		print("Too slow!")
	} else {
		vehicle.travel(distance: distance)
	}
}

let car = NewCar()
commute(distance: 100, using: car)



// MARK: Extensions

// Extensions let us add functionality to any type. For example, Swift‚Äôs strings have a method for trimming whitespace and new lines, but it‚Äôs quite long so we could turn it into an extension:

extension String {
	func trimmed() -> String {
		self.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)
	}
}

var quote2 = "   The truth is rarely pure and never simple   "
let trimmed = quote2.trimmed()



// MARK: Protocol extensions

// Protocol extensions extend a whole protocol to add computed properties and method implementations, so any types conforming to that protocol get them.

// For example, Array, Dictionary, and Set all conform to the Collection protocol, so we can add a computed property to all three of them like this:

extension Collection {
	var isNotEmpty: Bool {
		isEmpty == false
	}
}

let guests = ["Mario", "Luigi", "Peach"]

if guests.isNotEmpty {
	print("Guest count: \(guests.count)")
}


// MARK: Optionals

// Optionals represent the absence of data ‚Äì for example, they distinguish between an integer having the value 0, and having no value at all.

let opposites = [
	"Mario": "Wario",
	"Luigi": "Waluigi"
]

let peachOpposite = opposites["Peach"]



// MARK: Unwrapping optionals with guard

// Swift has a second way of unwrapping optionals, called guard let, which is very similar to if let except it flips things around: if let runs the code inside its braces if the optional had a value, and guard let runs the code if the optional didn‚Äôt have a value.

func printSquareNew(of number: Int?) {
	guard let number = number else {
		print("Missing input")
		return
	}

	print("\(number) x \(number) is \(number * number)")
}

// If you use guard to check a function‚Äôs inputs are valid, Swift requires you to use return if the check fails. However, if the optional you‚Äôre unwrapping has a value inside, you can use it after the guard code finishes.



// MARK: Nil coalescing

// Swift has a third way of unwrapping optionals, called the nil coalescing operator ‚Äì it unwraps an optional and provides a default value if the optional was empty:

let tvShows = ["Archer", "Babylon 5", "Ted Lasso"]
let favorite = tvShows.randomElement() ?? "None"





// MARK: Optional chaining

let names = ["Arya", "Bran", "Robb", "Sansa"]
let chosen = names.randomElement()?.uppercased()
print("Next in line: \(chosen ?? "No one")")




// MARK: Optional try?

// When calling a function that might throw errors, we can use try? to convert its result into an optional containing a value on success, or nil otherwise.

enum UserError: Error {
	case badID, networkFailed
}

func getUser(id: Int) throws -> String {
	throw UserError.networkFailed
}

if let user = try? getUser(id: 23) {
	print("User: \(user)")
}


// The getUser() function will always throw networkFailed, but we don‚Äôt care what was thrown ‚Äì all we care about is whether the call sent back a user or not.



// MARK: WRAP UP

// We‚Äôve covered the majority of Swift language fundamentals here, but really we‚Äôve only scratched the surface of what the language does. Fortunately, with what you‚Äôve learned you already know enough to build some fantastic software with Swift and SwiftUI.
